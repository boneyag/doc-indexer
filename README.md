## Library document indexer and searcher

The project uses [Whoosh](https://whoosh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/indexing.html) to index and search library documents.

The script need the html files to be stored in the data directory (e.g.,`<project_root>/data/<lib_name>/*.html`). The html files are not included in here. Create the data directory and other subdirectories and put all the files that need to be indexed in the subdirectories.
